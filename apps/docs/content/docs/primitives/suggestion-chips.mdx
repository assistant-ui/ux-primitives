## Overview

`SuggestionChips` renders a grid of suggestion buttons from a static list. Each chip wraps `ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion` which handles setting composer text or auto-sending on click.

## Demo

Click any chip to send the suggestion immediately.

<Tabs items={["After", "Before"]}>
  <Tab value="After">
    ```tsx
    <SuggestionChips
      suggestions={[
        {
          prompt: "Write a poem about the ocean",
          label: "Write a poem",
          description: "about the ocean",
        },
        "Help me plan a trip",
      ]}
    />
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Before">
    ```tsx
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
      <ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion
        prompt="Write a poem about the ocean"
        send
        className="..."
      >
        <span className="font-medium">Write a poem</span>
        <span className="text-muted">about the ocean</span>
      </ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion>

      <ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion
        prompt="Help me plan a trip"
        send
        className="..."
      >
        <span className="font-medium">Help me plan a trip</span>
      </ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion>
    </div>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Simple Strings

You can also pass plain strings — they're used as both prompt and label.

```tsx
<SuggestionChips
  suggestions={["Tell me a joke", "What's the weather?", "Write an email", "Summarize this article"]}
/>
```

## Underlying Primitives

- `ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion` — handles click-to-send and disabled state
- Does **not** require a message context — works at the thread level
- Typically used inside `ThreadPrimitive.Empty` or `ThreadEmpty`
