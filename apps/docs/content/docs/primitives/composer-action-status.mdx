title: ComposerActionStatus
description: A send/cancel button that auto-switches based on thread state.

## Overview

`ComposerActionStatus` replaces the common pattern of conditionally rendering a Send button when idle and a Cancel button when running. It reads the thread and composer state and renders the appropriate action automatically.

## Demo

Try typing in the input, sending a message, and watch the button change between idle, composing, and running states.

<Tabs items={["After", "Before"]}>
  <Tab value="After">
    ```tsx
    <ComposerPrimitive.Root>
      <ComposerPrimitive.Input />
      <ComposerActionStatus />
    </ComposerPrimitive.Root>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Before">
    ```tsx
    <ComposerPrimitive.Root>
      <ComposerPrimitive.Input />

      {/* Conditional rendering based on thread state */}
      <AuiIf condition={({ thread }) => !thread.isRunning}>
        <ComposerPrimitive.Send>
          <ArrowUpIcon />
        </ComposerPrimitive.Send>
      </AuiIf>
      <AuiIf condition={({ thread }) => thread.isRunning}>
        <ComposerPrimitive.Cancel>
          <StopIcon />
        </ComposerPrimitive.Cancel>
      </AuiIf>
    </ComposerPrimitive.Root>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## States

| State | Condition | Renders |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **idle** | Not running, composer is empty | Muted send button (disabled) |
| **composing** | Not running, composer has text | Active send button |
| **running** | Thread is running | Cancel/stop button |

## Props

<TypeTable
  type={{
    idleButtonClassName: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Class for the idle (empty composer) send button.",
    },
    buttonClassName: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Class for the composing/running action button.",
    },
    iconClassName: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Class for the icon inside the button.",
    },
    renderVisual: {
      type: "(state: 'idle' | 'composing' | 'running') => ReactNode",
      description: "Custom render function to replace the default icons entirely.",
    },
  }}
/>

## Underlying Primitives

- `ComposerPrimitive.Send` — for idle and composing states
- `ComposerPrimitive.Cancel` — for running state
- Uses `useThread()` and `useComposer()` hooks internally to derive state
