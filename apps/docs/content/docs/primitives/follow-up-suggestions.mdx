title: FollowUpSuggestions
description: Dynamic suggestion chips that appear after assistant messages.
---

## Overview

`FollowUpSuggestions` renders contextual suggestion buttons based on the runtime's `thread.suggestions` state. Unlike `SuggestionChips` which shows static welcome-screen suggestions, this component displays dynamic follow-up prompts generated by the runtime after each assistant response.

## Demo

<FollowUpSuggestionsDemo />

## When to use

- Show dynamic follow-up questions after assistant responses
- Help users discover related topics or actions
- Auto-hide during streaming and when no suggestions exist
- Commonly placed after the last assistant message or at the bottom of the viewport

## Features

- **Dynamic suggestions**: Reads from `thread.suggestions` state provided by the runtime
- **Auto-hide**: Hidden when thread is running or when no suggestions exist
- **Auto-send**: Clicks send the suggestion immediately by default
- **Customizable**: Override chip styling or provide a custom renderer

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `className` | string | - | Container class |
| `chipClassName` | string | - | Suggestion chip class |
| `autoSend` | boolean | `true` | Send message immediately on click |
| `renderChip` | function | - | Custom chip renderer |

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { FollowUpSuggestions } from "@assistant-ui/ux-primitives";

export function MyThread() {
  return (
    <ThreadPrimitive.Root>
      <ThreadPrimitive.Viewport>
        <ThreadPrimitive.Messages components={{ ... }} />
        <FollowUpSuggestions />
      </ThreadPrimitive.Viewport>
    </ThreadPrimitive.Root>
  );
}
```

## Providing Suggestions via Runtime

Follow-up suggestions are provided by a `SuggestionAdapter` on the runtime:

```tsx
const runtime = useLocalRuntime(MyModelAdapter, {
  adapters: {
    suggestion: {
      async *generate({ messages }) {
        const suggestions = await fetchSuggestions(messages);
        yield suggestions.map((text) => ({ prompt: text }));
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Custom Chip Renderer

```tsx
<FollowUpSuggestions
  renderChip={(prompt, index) => (
    <button key={index} className="my-custom-chip">
      {prompt}
    </button>
  )}
/>
```

## Custom Styling

```tsx
<FollowUpSuggestions
  className="flex flex-wrap gap-3 justify-center"
  chipClassName="rounded-lg bg-blue-500/20 px-4 py-2 text-sm hover:bg-blue-500/30"
/>
```

## SuggestionChips vs FollowUpSuggestions

| | SuggestionChips | FollowUpSuggestions |
|---|---|---|
| **Data source** | Static array you provide | Dynamic from runtime |
| **When shown** | Welcome screen (empty thread) | After assistant responses |
| **Placement** | Inside `ThreadPrimitive.Empty` | After messages in viewport |
